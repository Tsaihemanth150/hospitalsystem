Ambulances are equipped with medical equipment and staffed by trained healthcare professionals who provide emergency medical care to patients at the scene of an emergency and during transport to a hospital.

Ambulance services are typically dispatched by emergency medical services (EMS) providers who receive calls for emergency medical assistance through a <b> 104 emergency call center </b>. The EMS provider will dispatch an ambulance to the location of the emergency, and the ambulance crew will provide medical care to the patient at the scene of the emergency. This can include administering medication, providing oxygen, immobilizing injuries, and performing life-saving procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or defibrillation
